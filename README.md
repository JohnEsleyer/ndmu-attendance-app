# NDMU-Attendance-App
 A mobile attendance system that uses QR code for student log in. Made for Notre Dame of Marbel University. This project was made as a project for my Software Engineering subject. 

Frameworks used:
- Flutter  (Mobile App)
- Spring Boot (server-side app): Responsible for managing the database and generating QR codes and PDF reports

Note that the source code is quite messy, this project was made for learning purposes only.
